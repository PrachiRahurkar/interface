        <p>1. BERT is a state-of-the-art language model released by Google in 2018.
        It can be used for a variety of natural language tasks. It is trained on billion words from the Wikipedia corpora.</p>
        <p>2. Here, we use BERT for the task of Question-Answering. Given a paragraph and a question, BERT answers the question based on the para.</p>
        <p>3. Your job is to provide a perturbed paragraph to the trained model. And then hit predict.</p>
        <p>4. Modify the paragraph, such that the correct answer is still in the paragraph.</p>
        <p>(Meaning, edit the para in such a way that a human can still correctly answer the ground truth from your para. But the model cannot.)</p>
        <p>5. You can find some examples of adversaries which are successfully able to fool the model in the tab "Adversarial attack examples".</p>
        <br><p><h3>Edit the Custom Paragraph in the textbox. After you are done editing, click Predict.</h3></p>
        <h3>Submit your example when you succeed in fooling the model.</h3>
        <p>( Remember to add/delete to the paragraph without changing the Ground Truth. )</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
